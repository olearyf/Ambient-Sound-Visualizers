# Ambient-Sound-Visualizers
Essentially a dumping ground for all the ambient sound visualizers I make in Processing.

## Failed Lissajous
In this sketch I had attempted to plot a lissajous curve that varies with an audio input. I struggled with scaling the audio input into a lissajous curve that would change with time, so I steered into the skid (so to speak) and united my non-curvy lines into semi-curvy lines using the bezier function in Processing. I also kept the fill on, and then made the opacity of past curves vary with the volume of the noise the program picks up; quieter and the images will persist, louder and the images will be more fleeting.
