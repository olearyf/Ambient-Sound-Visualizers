# Ambient-Sound-Visualizers
Essentially a dumping ground for all the ambient sound visualizers I make in Processing.

## Failed Lissajous
In this sketch I had attempted to plot a lissajous curve that varies with an audio input. I struggled with scaling the audio input into a lissajous curve that would change with time, so I steered into the skid (so to speak) and united my non-curvy lines into semi-curvy lines using the bezier function in Processing. I also kept the fill on, and then made the opacity of past curves vary with the volume of the noise the program picks up; quieter and the images will persist, louder and the images will be more fleeting. Below is a snapshot:

## Fourier Circle Experiment
In this sketch I isolated the circles that can be used to graph a Fourier transform. Its color changes with the ambient noise, as does the opacity, speed of rotation, and number of circles. In the future I want it to either draw a path or adjust the colors so they're prettier. It was a nice introduction to Fourier circles thought. Below is a snapshot:

*this is a note to myself to continue to add images, and to take screenshots of these programs in varying states and create a tiled result*
## Flying Nums
This sketch isn't sound reactive but it didn't seem to warrant its own repo to its here. It basically sandwiches you between two moving 'terrain' maps of digits 0-9, and you can move around the space using PeasyCam. Below is a snapshot:

## Math Practice
This sketch also isn't sound reactive but it's Processing so I thought I'd put it here. Helping me understand differential equations and linear algebra; specifically phase portraits. Below is a snapshot:
